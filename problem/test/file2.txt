In probability theory and statistics, Bayes�s theorem (alternatively Bayes�s law or Bayes�s 
rule) describes the probability of an event, based on prior knowledge of conditions that might 
be related to the event. For example, if cancer is related to age, then, using Bayes� theorem, a 
person's age can be used to more accurately assess the probability that they have cancer than 
can be done without knowledge of the person�s age. 
Bayes� theorem is named after Reverend Thomas Bayes, who first used conditional 
probability to provide an algorithm (his Proposition 9) that uses evidence to calculate limits 
on an unknown parameter, published as An Essay towards solving a Problem in the Doctrine 
of Chances (1763).
According the frequentist interpretation, probability measures a �proportion of results.� For 
instance, suppose an experiment is performed many times. P(A) is the proportion of 
results with property A, and P(B) that with property B. P(B?|?A) is the proportion of 
results with property B out of outcomes with property A, and P(A?|?B) the proportion of 
those with A out of those with B. Bayes' theorem serves as the link between these different partitionings. 
Bayes� theorem was named after Thomas Bayes, who studied how to compute a 
distribution for the probability parameter of a binomial distribution. 
Bayes�s unpublished manuscript was repeatedly edited by other scientists specially Price.
By modern standards, we should refer to the Bayes�Price rule. Price discovered Bayes� work, 
recognized its importance, corrected it, contributed to the article, and found a use for it. The 
modern convention of employing Bayes� name alone is unfair but so entrenched that anything 
else makes little sense.
