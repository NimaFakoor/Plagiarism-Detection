Who was Bayes?
Thomas Bayes (1701 - 1761) was an English theologian and mathematician that belonged to 
the Royal Society (the oldest national scientific society in the world and the leading national 
organisation for the promotion of scientific research in Britain), where other eminent 
individuals have enrolled, like Newton, Darwin or Faraday. He developed one of the most 
important theorems of probability, which coined his name: Bayes� Theorem, or the Theorem 
of Conditional Probability.
The Theorem: Conditional Probability
To explain this theorem, we will use a very simple example. Imagine you have been 
diagnosed with a very rare disease, which only affects 0.1% of the population; that is, 1 in 
every 1000 persons.
The test you have taken to check for the disease correctly classifies 99% of the people who 
have the disease, incorrectly classifying healthy individuals with a 1% chance.
I am doomed! Is this disease fatal doctor?
Is what most people would say. However, after this test, what are the chances we have of 
actually suffering the disease?
99% for sure! I better get my stuff in order.
Upon this thought, Bayes� mentality ought to prevail, as it is actually very far off from 
reality. Lets use Bayes� Theorem to gain some perspective.
Bayes� Theorem, or as I have called it before, the Theorem of Conditional Probability, is used 
for calculating the probability of a hypothesis (H) being true (ie. having the disease) given 
that a certain event (E) has happened (being diagnosed positive of this disease in the test).
The intuition behind the theorem
The intuition behind this famous theorem is that we can never be fully certain of the world, as 
it is a changing being, change is in the nature of reality. However, something that we can do, 
which is the fundamental principle behind this theorem, is update and improve our 
knowledge of reality as we get more and more data or evidence.
This can be illustrated with a very simple example. Imagine the following situation: you are 
in the edge square shaped garden, sitting on a chair, looking outside the garden. On the 
opposite side, lies a servant that throws a initial blue ball inside the square. After that, he 
keeps throwing other yellow balls inside the square, and telling you where they land 
relatively to the initial blue ball. As more and more yellow balls land, and you get informed 
of where they land relative to the first blue ball, you gradually increase your knowledge of 
where the blue ball might be, leaving out certain parts of the garden: as we get more evidence 
(more yellow balls) we update our knowledge (the position of the blue ball). In the example 
above, with only 3 yellow balls thrown, we could already start to build a certain idea that the 
blue ball lies somewhere within the top left corner of the garden.
When Bayes� first formulated this theorem, he didn�t publish it at first, thinking it was 
nothing extraordinary, and the papers where the theorem was formulated were found after his 
death. Today Bayes� theorem is not only one of the bases of modern probability, but a highly 
used tool in many intelligent systems like spam filters, and many other text and non text 
related problem solvers.
